# Mukul Chhabra

Applied AI engineer building production-grade LLM systems focused on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), evaluation frameworks, observability, and reliability.

I work at the intersection of research and real-world deployment — designing systems that are measurable, scalable, and production-ready.

---

## What I Work On

- Enterprise RAG architectures and hybrid retrieval
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks
- Observability and telemetry for AI systems
- Failure mode analysis and reliability engineering
- Agent orchestration and tool-calling systems
- Cost, latency, and scalability tradeoffs

### RAG Production Patterns
Production design patterns covering routing, hybrid retrieval, guardrails, caching, evaluation loops, and operational best practices.

### LLM Observability
Logging, tracing, and monitoring schemas for production LLM applications with evaluation telemetry patterns.
